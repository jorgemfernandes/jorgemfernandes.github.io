In this article, we unmask the indirect effects of gender quotas by arguing that electoral threats act as a political competition mechanism changing elites’ strategic calculations about women’s inclusiveness. Using legislative debates in Portugal, we show that parties that voted against the gender quota reform but face an electoral threat adopt women-friendly stances in order to signal to voters that they are responsive to changes in the salience of gender. In contrast, parties that opposed the gender quota reform but do not face an electoral threat engage in strategies that are dismissive of these new policies.

	      <p> The emergence of the radical right signals that social norms and values are changing. Existing literature suggests that citizens choose to voice their concerns when faced with the erosion of democracy. In this paper, we look at the consequences of citizens using quoted tweets to express negative sentiments to denounce and discredit the radical right. Using Twitter data from Portugal, we use node embeddings to map out interactions on social media. Subsequently, we estimate a deep-learning automated sentiment analysis of quoted tweets and use a vector auto-regression model to forecast who contributes the most to the growth of the radical right on Twitter. Our findings show that users amplify the radical right’s original message via weak ties and cascade effects in making negative quoted tweets. Ultimately, denouncing the radical right backfires and helps nascent illiberal parties to reach out to more users in the network and gain more users. </p>

      <p>Democratic societies increasingly look into gender quotas as a means to increase women’s representation in politics. Yet even as women occupy more seats, meaningful barriers may remain to their incorporation in the legislature. Our paper draws on quantitative and interview data from Portugal to explore patterns in women’s legislative participation before and after the adoption of a gender quota. While the gender gap in floor time decreases post-quota, important gender imbalances remain. After the quota, women remain underrepresented in the most politically salient legislative debates and are subject to stigmatization in floor access. Our findings suggest that gender quotas chip away at, but do not shatter, glass ceilings for women in politics.</p>

    <p> Embeddings have gained traction in the social sciences in recent years. Existing work focuses on text-as-data to estimate word embeddings. In this paper, we turn to graph embeddings as a tool whose use has been overlooked in the analysis of social networks. Graph embeddings have two primary uses. First, to encode users and their interactions onto a single vector. Second, graph embeddings can be used as inputs for machine-learning classifiers. In this paper, we use the British political Twitter to illustrate both uses of graph embeddings. We encode users’ partisanship. Furthermore, we use an SVM and a NN to estimate the partisan proximity of Twitter users. Results suggest that graph embeddings yield high precision predictions. </p>

    <p> Legislative committees usually combine legislative and oversight functions. Most research has focused on the former. The British House of Commons offers an opportunity to shed light on MPs’ motivations to engage in the neglected oversight aspects of committee work, because its committee system separates lawmaking from investigatory functions. In this article, we examine the politics of assignment to the investigatory select committees. Using an original data set for the 2005–10 and 2010–15 Parliaments, we find that MPs’ long-standing policy interests are a strong and consistent predictor for select-committee assignments, especially when committees’ desirability increases. Our results are largely incompatible with partisan models predicting party loyalty to be a decisive factor in select-committee assignments. Evidence suggests that the “Wright reforms” have consolidated the self-selection mechanism operating in committee assignments. Against expectations of partisan motivations driving committee assignments, our evidence suggests that models based on informational concerns offer the most convincing rationale. </p>

  abstract = {Legislative committees usually combine legislative and oversight functions. Most research has focused on the former. The British House of Commons offers an opportunity to shed light on MPs’ motivations to engage in the neglected oversight aspects of committee work, because its committee system separates lawmaking from investigatory functions. In this article, we examine the politics of assignment to the investigatory select committees. Using an original data set for the 2005–10 and 2010–15 Parliaments, we find that MPs’ long-standing policy interests are a strong and consistent predictor for select-committee assignments, especially when committees’ desirability increases. Our results are largely incompatible with partisan models predicting party loyalty to be a decisive factor in select-committee assignments. Evidence suggests that the “Wright reforms” have consolidated the self-selection mechanism operating in committee assignments. Against expectations of partisan motivations driving committee assignments, our evidence suggests that models based on informational concerns offer the most convincing rationale.},

    <p> Legislative debates are a thriving field in comparative politics. They make representation work by offering legislators the opportunity to take the floor and represent their constituents. In this paper, we review the key theoretical concepts and empirical findings in a maturing field. We begin by addressing what legislative debates are and why we should study them to learn about inter- and intra-party politics. Next, we look at the contributions springing from Proksch and Slapin's ground-breaking model. In so doing, our review suggests that recent work extends the original model to include further dimensions of legislative debates. Third, we examine the role of legislative debates as mechanisms of representation, focusing on gender. Four, we examine the challenges of the comparative analysis of legislative debates. Finally, we map the road ahead by discussing four avenues of future research and some key questions that remain unanswered. </p>

    <p> Embeddings have gained traction in the social sciences in recent years. Existing work focuses on text-as-data to estimate word embeddings. In this paper, we turn to graph embeddings as a tool whose use has been overlooked in the analysis of social networks. Graph embeddings have two primary uses. First, to encode users and their interactions onto a single vector. Second, graph embeddings can be used as inputs for machine-learning classifiers. In this paper, we use the British political Twitter to illustrate both uses of graph embeddings. We encode users’ partisanship. Furthermore, we use an SVM and a NN to estimate the partisan proximity of Twitter users. Results suggest that graph embeddings yield high precision predictions. </p>
